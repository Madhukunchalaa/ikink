            <p>The level of insurance coverage can largely vary from one business entity to the other. Your restaurant business size, nature of activities, and likely associated risks are a few that are considered while designing a restaurant insurance policy. Please get in touch with an insurance broker as they come with a deep understanding of every aspect connected to policies, premiums, and claims.</p>
            <p>For example, if you have rented or leased out a property for your restaurant business, there might be a minimum amount of glass cover and public liability insurance that your property owner may specify.</p>

How an insurance payout is treated depends on what the payout is for, how the insurance is used, the amount of payout, the kind of property (owned/rented), and its value.</p>
