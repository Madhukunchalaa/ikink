        <h3>Key Scaffolding insurance services</h3>
        <p>The scaffolding business’s biggest threat is improper scaffolding that leads to serious injury/loss of life. The onsite activities are beyond your control, and claims may fall on you even before you can be at the site to get hold of the situation. Hence public liability insurance is seen as vital.</p>
        <p>Scaffolding comes with a risk of property damage, a severe human injury or sometimes even a loss of life on the job. As the risks to scaffolding are higher so are the costs and financial consequences that you may have to incur, if your business is found to be at fault. The eventualities of such damages against your business and your repute can be covered by the public liability insurance. From accidental claim costs, professional negligence claim, to the legal expenses that you may have to incur during such a claim process are covered.</p>
        <h3>2. Income Protection</h3>
        <p>Income protection insurance is highly recommended for self-employed individuals. Unlike worker’s compensation where the employer compensates for the employee’s loss, if you work on your own or are employed on wages, income protection insurance helps you to financially sustain the period. Scaffolding is prone to high risk injuries and income protection insurance will ensure that you are provided for, and your income is safeguarded until you get back to work.</p>
        <h3>3. Tools, Equipment & Stock Insurance</h3>
        <p>This insurance provides a cover for theft, fire, damage, and loss of scaffolders equipment one that is used as part of the projects and another that covers the loss, theft, or damage to the ones stocked on a client’s site. An insurance cover will help you with the expenses of tool replacements. For larger scaffolding specific equipment used on the site, a specific plant cover insurance may be provided.</p>
        <h3>4. Hired-in Equipment Insurance</h3>
        <p>This insurance provides a cover against loss, theft, and damage of scaffolding equipment on the project site, for an array of equipment including mobile scaffolding towers or lift machines that had been rented as part of your project. Save on the expense of repair/loss/replacement of scaffolding equipment by getting them insured.</p>
        <h3>5. Contract Works Insurance</h3>
        <p>Contract works insurance provides for any claims done while the project is under tender or post completion period.</p>
        <h3>6. Professional Indemnity</h3>
        <p>Unlike public liability insurance, a professional indemnity is something that protects you and your company’s reputation. It provides a cover for any kind of error or breach of your professional duty</p>
