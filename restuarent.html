      <h3>When to take the insurance?</h3>
     <p>Wet floors, broken glass, or faults found in food served, are some aspects that are common and real in the hospitality business. For the customer, it is a place to have food, but for the restaurateurs, it is a daily business to handle food, logistics, food quality, staff, and customer service. Given a such scenario, the restaurant business is vulnerable to risks, and so it is highly recommended to take an insurance policy that can safeguard you and provide for costs when unforeseen accidents and claims occur.</p>

                <p>The level of insurance coverage can largely vary from one business entity to the other. Your restaurant business size, nature of activities, and likely associated risks are a few that are considered while designing a restaurant insurance policy. Please get in touch with an insurance broker as they come with a deep understanding of every aspect connected to policies, premiums, and claims.</p>
                <p>For example, if you have rented or leased out a property for your restaurant business, there might be a minimum amount of glass cover and public liability insurance that your property owner may specify.</p>

                <p>Insurance claims are generally claimed against a loss/damage and tend to be seen as an ordinary income. However, there are a lot of aspects that determine whether the said claim falls under taxable income or not. How an insurance payout is treated depends on what the payout is for, how the insurance is used, the amount of payout, the kind of property (owned/rented), and its value.</p>
                <p>Claims and their accounting mandates can be tricky with several factors in consideration. You may speak to our insurance expert to rightly understand your situation and guide you through the process.</p>
