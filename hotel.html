      <h3>Hotel Insurance</h3>
      <p>Hotel insurance majorly covers both liability and property coverage to help hotel businesses to safeguard
        themselves from lawsuits and claims that accuse them of harm/loss to others, and also cover their property for
        damages. A single policy may cover different coverages from buildings, other structures, equipment, and
        inventory to that covered from uncertain incidents to staff and guests as well.</p>

      <h3>Why Hotel Insurance Is Needed?</h3>
      <p>Any property carrying a business activity is advised to have their property insured. A hotel business carries
        both liability risks as well as the risk of fire accidents in general. No two businesses are the same, however,
        the use of multiple electronic and electrical appliances as a source for ignition, and on-premises food
        preparations are some of the common activities that leave your hotel business at high risk for electrical
        mishaps and fire accidents. From vandalism to accidents occurring due to intoxicated customers are other risks
        associated with hotel business, apart from standard slips, falls, and property damage that you should be
        cautious about.</p>

      <p>Hotel business is a service sector with hospitality at its core, hence you are dealing with a number of clients
        and your staff on an everyday basis. In such a scenario having your hotel business covered for property,
        equipment, as well as public liability remains crucial for your business. Get hotel property insurance and hotel
        liability insurance tailored to your specific needs.</p>

      <h3>Who Needs Hotel Insurance?</h3>
      <p>Owners and operators of accommodation services such as motels, hotels, guest houses, pubs, and bars are
        recommended to have a planned insurance policy that can cover your property, assets, and staff as well as
        peacefully manage clientsâ€™ and other third-party claims.</p>

      <h3>When To Take Insurance?</h3>
      <p>No matter the size of your hotel business, the risk and the expense to get back after a natural calamity, a
        fire mishap, or handling the costs of a machinery breakdown can be high. Often standard falls, slips, or food
        poisoning are something so unexpected that you got to be prepared for claims coming against you, which can
        hamper your business and its reputation. It is recommended that as and when you invest in your hotel business,
        you also it insured. Hotel insurance brokers are trained to holistically look into your business activity,
        nature, and size and then provide you with hotel insurance with the best possible coverage for both property and
        people.</p>
      <h3>Benefits Of Having The Insurance</h3>
      <p>A proper well-planned hotel insurance can help cover the following aspects, deal financial losses, third-party
        claims, handle costs and business interruption.</p>

        </div>

      <h3>Liability Coverage</h3>
      <h4>1. Public and product liability insurance</h4>
      <p>It provides a cover for all the obligations including property damage, and personal loss/injury that is caused
        due to the negligent action of you or your employees to your clients or any third-party, due to your business
        activities. This also includes the food you have supplied or served resulting in a mishap. Public and product
        liability insurance comes as part of a commercial lease document for hotel operators.</p>
      <p>A holistic cover against claims done by the guests for illness/food poisoning, pollution coverage, bodily
        injury, or property damage to clients that occurred in your hotel premises, is what liability insurance is all
        about.</p>
      <h4>2. Business interruption insurance</h4>
      <p>It is a policy that helps you cover an insured event and provide for the ongoing costs and safeguard the gross
        profit margins for the period of your business activity that got interrupted due to a natural disaster. This
        helps claim for business downtime and loss of income due to reasons like outages, equipment breakdown, and other
        unforeseen perils.</p>
      <h4>3. Employee practices liability</h4>
      <p>This helps the business to cover settlements, managementâ€™s defense costs, employee claims for breach, violation
        of laws, and any kind of claims from third parties that include past employees, vendors, contractors, clients,
        and others.</p>
      <h4>4. Cyber liability</h4>
      <p>Cyber liability insurance provides recovery from network privacy breaches and any kind of compromise on the
        data and information of the guests.</p>
      <h4>5. Employee dishonesty</h4>
      <p>This insurance covers you for any fraudulent activity by your employed staff with an intent to make financial
        gain through an act of dishonesty.</p>
      <h4>6. Liquor liability</h4>
      <p>If your hotel space has bars and offers liquor, liquor liability insurance gives cover for damage or injuries
        and claims demanded by customers.</p>
      <h4>7. Workers' compensation coverage</h4>
      <p>This helps to provide cover for any kind of medical expenses for illness/injury that occurred to your
        staff/employees while they are on the job or because of your hotel business. While workerâ€™s compensation
        insurance will provide a cover only for business hours, it is important for employees to look into injury
        insurance and income protection and how it can benefit them and their families.</p>
      <h4>8. Personal accidents and illness cover</h4>
      <p>If you are someone running a business under a proprietary holding (self-employed) or are part of the
        management, and if your State does not provide you a cover under the workerâ€™s compensation insurance, you are
        recommended to look out for personal accidents and illness cover and a business continuance expenses cover.</p>
      <p>Accidents and illness cover can give you a financial cover of around 85% of your weekly income (if all terms
        are satisfied, and are applicable) for a said short-term period until you recover, and also claim for lump sum
        benefits if permanent damage occurs. Every event is unique, so it is highly recommended that you go through the
        PDS document carefully, with the help of an insurance broker who can simplify information for you.</p>
      <h4>9. Income protection insurance</h4>
      <p>Income protection insurance provides long-term cover for the time that you are unable to work and gives you
        accidental finance cover for a loss of income during your recovery period.</p>

      <h3>Property Coverage</h3>
      <h4>1. Equipment & machine breakdown</h4>
      <p>Property insurance that helps to cover your expenses for the repair or replacement of equipment and machinery
        and also provides cover for the deterioration of stock following such a breakdown. Although machinery breakdown
        is the most common insurance undertaken by hotel operators, it also is complex in ways where some equipment may
        not be eligible for a cover, while others do. Therefore, it is highly important to read and know the level of
        coverage specified under the said policy you are wanting to take.</p>
      <h4>2. Food spoil/Deterioration of stock</h4>
      <p>Compensation for the loss/ food spoilage after an incident at the premises or as a result of machinery
        breakdown. Hotels have a lot of food stocked in cold storage and often face a huge financial burden not just
        with handling an accident/property loss, but also the impact of it due to loads of food wastage.</p>
      <h4>3. Auto liability insurance</h4>
      <p>For hotels that own vehicles to carry inventory and stock, which requires State-level mandates.</p>
      <h3>How Much Is Covered Under The Hotel Insurance Coverage?</h3>
      <p>Whether you run a hotel, motel, or guest house business, as a property owner, or on a property that is
        commercially leased for business, the price for insurance and the level of coverage depend on a lot of factors.
        Your business turnover is an indicator to estimate and arrive at an appropriate insurance plan that provides you
        with the right amount and kind of coverage.</p>
      <p>There is no â€˜one size fits allâ€™ kind of coverage that hotel insurance prescribes to. Therefore, the coverage
        depends on the various factors that influence your hotel business including business size, customer base, the
        kind of equipment you use, and risks associated.</p>
      <h3>How To Renew Insurance?</h3>
      <p>If you already have taken an insurance plan with ilink insurance, our team will contact you well in advance to
        remind you of the renewal date and also to have an update about your business. In case of any changes to your
        business that may require a change/upgrade to your hotel insurance, we will recommend the same to you. We are
        here to carefully review your hotel insurance plan, and coverage levels, and once you are okay with everything,
        you can go ahead and pay to renew your insurance.</p>
      <h3>Claim Process & What Are The Documents Required?</h3>

        have an expert look into the nitty-gritty of the matter. Ilink insurance has been one of the most trusted

            <p>A hotel would need both property insurance as well as liability insurance. Typically customized hotel insurance should include:</p>

            <li>Commercial property and asset insurance</li>

Therefore, it is recommended to take support from expert hotel insurance brokers who can help simplify the entire process for you and suggest a suitable insurance plan.</p>

         <p>Public liability claims can be very costly, hence it is recommended for hotel operators to have insurance coverage in accordance with their size and nature of business. Hospitality establishment and their business activities are largely connected to people and their needs. It is a service based sector, from taking bookings, housekeeping, food, and entertainment to comfort, everything involves people and management on a daily basis. This widely puts hotels and hospitality establishments at high risk of potential liabilities</p>

         <p>From public claims for an unforeseen accident when it occurs, or for sensitive data getting breached because of management negligence, at every step, the hotel business is prone to vulnerability. Therefore, public and product liability insurance is common insurance taken that ensures hospitality establishments have comprehensive coverage against all these business associated risks and vulnerabilities.</p>
